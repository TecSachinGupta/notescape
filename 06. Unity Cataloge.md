## Three-Level Namespace

Unity Catalog implements a three-level namespace hierarchy that provides logical organization while maintaining flexibility and scalability.

### Namespace Structure

The three-level namespace follows the pattern: `catalog.schema.object`, where:

**Catalog**: The top-level container that typically represents a business unit, department, or major functional area. Examples include `sales`, `marketing`, `finance`, or `engineering`.

**Schema**: The mid-level container that groups related objects, often representing a specific project, application, or data domain. Examples include `customer_analytics`, `product_catalog`, or `financial_reporting`.

**Object**: The bottom-level entity that represents actual data assets like tables, views, functions, or models. Examples include `customer_transactions`, `product_inventory`, or `revenue_forecast`.

### Practical Implementation

```sql
-- Example namespace usage
SELECT * FROM sales.customer_analytics.customer_transactions;
SELECT * FROM marketing.campaign_data.email_metrics;
SELECT * FROM finance.reporting.monthly_revenue;
```

### Namespace Benefits

**Logical Organization**: The hierarchical structure mirrors organizational boundaries and business processes, making it intuitive for users to navigate and find relevant data.

**Security Boundaries**: Each level of the namespace can have distinct security policies, enabling fine-grained access control that aligns with organizational structure.

**Scalability**: The three-level approach scales effectively from small teams to large enterprises without becoming unwieldy or complex.
