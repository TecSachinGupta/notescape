# SQL Theory Guide

## 1. Joins

Joins combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

### Types of Joins

**INNER JOIN**: Returns only matching rows from both tables
```sql
SELECT a.id, a.name, b.department
FROM employees a
INNER JOIN departments b ON a.dept_id = b.id
```

**LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from left table, matched rows from right table
```sql
SELECT a.name, b.department
FROM employees a
LEFT JOIN departments b ON a.dept_id = b.id
```

**RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from right table, matched rows from left table
```sql
SELECT a.name, b.department
FROM employees a
RIGHT JOIN departments b ON a.dept_id = b.id
```

**FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all rows when there's a match in either table
```sql
SELECT a.name, b.department
FROM employees a
FULL OUTER JOIN departments b ON a.dept_id = b.id
```

**CROSS JOIN**: Returns Cartesian product of both tables
```sql
SELECT a.name, b.department
FROM employees a
CROSS JOIN departments b
```

**SELF JOIN**: Joins a table with itself
```sql
SELECT e1.name as employee, e2.name as manager
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.id
```

## 2. Ranking Functions

Window functions that assign ranks to rows within a partition.

### RANK()
Assigns ranks with gaps for ties
```sql
SELECT name, salary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank
FROM employees
-- Result: 1, 2, 2, 4, 5 (gap after tie)
```

### DENSE_RANK()
Assigns ranks without gaps for ties
```sql
SELECT name, salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as dense_rank
FROM employees
-- Result: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4 (no gap after tie)
```

### ROW_NUMBER()
Assigns unique sequential numbers regardless of ties
```sql
SELECT name, salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as row_num
FROM employees
-- Result: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (always unique)
```

### NTILE()
Divides result set into specified number of groups
```sql
SELECT name, salary, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as quartile
FROM employees
```

## 3. Subqueries

Nested queries that can be used in SELECT, FROM, WHERE, or HAVING clauses.

### Scalar Subqueries
Return single value
```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)
```

### Correlated Subqueries
Reference columns from outer query
```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees e2 WHERE e2.dept_id = e1.dept_id)
```

### EXISTS Subqueries
Check for existence of rows
```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.employee_id = e.id)
```

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Temporary named result sets
```sql
WITH dept_avg AS (
    SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY dept_id
)
SELECT e.name, e.salary, d.avg_salary
FROM employees e
JOIN dept_avg d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
```

## 4. Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) Types

Methods for handling changes in dimension tables over time.

### Type 0: Retain Original
No changes allowed - original value is preserved
```sql
-- Example: Employee ID - never changes
UPDATE employees SET employee_id = 'NEW_ID' WHERE id = 1; -- Not allowed
```

### Type 1: Overwrite
Replace old value with new value
```sql
-- Example: Employee phone number
UPDATE employees SET phone = '555-9999' WHERE id = 1;
```

### Type 2: Add New Record
Keep historical records by adding new rows
```sql
-- Example: Employee department change
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department, effective_date, end_date, is_current)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'Sales', '2024-01-01', '9999-12-31', TRUE);

-- When department changes
UPDATE employees SET end_date = '2024-06-30', is_current = FALSE WHERE id = 1 AND is_current = TRUE;
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department, effective_date, end_date, is_current)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'Marketing', '2024-07-01', '9999-12-31', TRUE);
```

### Type 3: Add New Attribute
Add columns to track previous values
```sql
-- Example: Employee address
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN previous_address VARCHAR(255);
UPDATE employees SET previous_address = address, address = 'New Address' WHERE id = 1;
```

### Type 4: History Table
Separate table for historical records
```sql
-- Current table
CREATE TABLE employees_current (id, name, department, effective_date);

-- History table
CREATE TABLE employees_history (id, name, department, effective_date, end_date);
```

## 5. Partitioning vs Bucketing

### Partitioning
Divides table into segments based on column values
```sql
-- Range Partitioning
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id INT,
    sale_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(sale_date)) (
    PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024),
    PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025)
);

-- List Partitioning
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    region VARCHAR(10)
) PARTITION BY LIST (region) (
    PARTITION p_north VALUES IN ('North', 'Northeast'),
    PARTITION p_south VALUES IN ('South', 'Southeast')
);
```

### Bucketing (Hash Partitioning)
Distributes data across fixed number of buckets using hash function
```sql
-- Hive example
CREATE TABLE user_data (
    user_id INT,
    username STRING,
    email STRING
)
CLUSTERED BY (user_id) INTO 10 BUCKETS;
```

**Key Differences:**
- **Partitioning**: Based on data values, variable number of partitions
- **Bucketing**: Based on hash function, fixed number of buckets
- **Partitioning**: Better for range queries and data pruning
- **Bucketing**: Better for joins and sampling

## 6. Star vs Snowflake Schemas

### Star Schema
Central fact table connected to dimension tables in star-like structure
```sql
-- Fact table
CREATE TABLE sales_fact (
    sale_id INT,
    date_key INT,
    product_key INT,
    customer_key INT,
    store_key INT,
    quantity INT,
    amount DECIMAL
);

-- Dimension tables (denormalized)
CREATE TABLE date_dim (
    date_key INT,
    date DATE,
    day_name VARCHAR(10),
    month_name VARCHAR(10),
    quarter INT,
    year INT
);
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple structure, easy to understand
- Better query performance (fewer joins)
- Easier for business users

**Disadvantages:**
- Data redundancy
- Larger storage requirements
- More complex ETL for updates

### Snowflake Schema
Normalized version of star schema where dimension tables are further normalized
```sql
-- Fact table (same as star)
CREATE TABLE sales_fact (...);

-- Normalized dimension tables
CREATE TABLE date_dim (
    date_key INT,
    date DATE,
    month_key INT,
    quarter_key INT,
    year_key INT
);

CREATE TABLE month_dim (
    month_key INT,
    month_name VARCHAR(10),
    month_number INT
);

CREATE TABLE quarter_dim (
    quarter_key INT,
    quarter_name VARCHAR(10),
    quarter_number INT
);
```

**Advantages:**
- Reduced data redundancy
- Better data integrity
- Smaller storage footprint

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex queries (more joins)
- Potentially slower performance
- More complex for business users

## 7. Query Optimization

### Indexing Strategies
```sql
-- B-tree index for equality and range queries
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_dept ON employees(department_id);

-- Composite index for multi-column queries
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name_dept ON employees(last_name, department_id);

-- Covering index includes all needed columns
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_covering ON employees(department_id) INCLUDE (first_name, last_name, salary);
```

### Query Optimization Techniques

**Use appropriate WHERE clauses**
```sql
-- Good: Uses index
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 5;

-- Bad: Prevents index usage
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id + 1 = 6;
```

**Avoid SELECT ***
```sql
-- Good: Specific columns
SELECT name, salary FROM employees;

-- Bad: All columns
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

**Use EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries**
```sql
-- Better performance
SELECT name FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.employee_id = e.id);

-- Potentially slower
SELECT name FROM employees
WHERE id IN (SELECT employee_id FROM orders);
```

**Use LIMIT for large result sets**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## 8. Windowing Functions

Perform calculations across a set of rows related to current row.

### Basic Window Function Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2,
       FUNCTION() OVER (
           PARTITION BY column1
           ORDER BY column2
           ROWS/RANGE BETWEEN start AND end
       ) as window_result
FROM table_name;
```

### Common Window Functions

**Aggregate Functions**
```sql
SELECT name, salary, department,
       AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as dept_avg_salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) as running_total
FROM employees;
```

**Ranking Functions**
```sql
SELECT name, salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as dense_rank,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as row_num
FROM employees;
```

**Value Functions**
```sql
SELECT name, salary,
       LAG(salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) as prev_salary,
       LEAD(salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) as next_salary,
       FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY hire_date) as first_salary,
       LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY hire_date) as last_salary
FROM employees;
```

### Frame Clauses
```sql
-- ROWS: Physical number of rows
SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING)

-- RANGE: Logical range of values
SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' MONTH PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
```

## 9. Order of Execution

SQL queries execute in specific order, different from written order:

### Logical Order
1. **FROM** - Identify source tables
2. **JOIN** - Combine tables
3. **WHERE** - Filter rows
4. **GROUP BY** - Group rows
5. **HAVING** - Filter groups
6. **SELECT** - Choose columns
7. **DISTINCT** - Remove duplicates
8. **ORDER BY** - Sort results
9. **LIMIT/OFFSET** - Limit results

### Example Query
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary          -- 6. Select columns
FROM employees e                                       -- 1. From table
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id                -- 2. Join tables
WHERE e.hire_date > '2020-01-01'                      -- 3. Filter rows
GROUP BY department                                    -- 4. Group rows
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000                            -- 5. Filter groups
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC                               -- 7. Sort results
LIMIT 10;                                             -- 8. Limit results
```

## 10. Aggregation

### Basic Aggregate Functions
```sql
SELECT department,
       COUNT(*) as employee_count,
       AVG(salary) as avg_salary,
       MIN(salary) as min_salary,
       MAX(salary) as max_salary,
       SUM(salary) as total_salary,
       STDDEV(salary) as salary_stddev
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

### Advanced Aggregation

**ROLLUP**: Creates subtotals and grand totals
```sql
SELECT department, job_title, COUNT(*), AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY ROLLUP(department, job_title);
```

**CUBE**: Creates all possible combinations of groupings
```sql
SELECT department, job_title, COUNT(*), AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY CUBE(department, job_title);
```

**GROUPING SETS**: Specify exact groupings
```sql
SELECT department, job_title, COUNT(*), AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
    (department),
    (job_title),
    (department, job_title),
    ()
);
```

### Conditional Aggregation
```sql
SELECT department,
       COUNT(*) as total_employees,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN salary > 50000 THEN 1 END) as high_earners,
       AVG(CASE WHEN job_title = 'Manager' THEN salary END) as avg_manager_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

## 11. Monthly/Yearly Analysis

### Date Functions for Analysis
```sql
-- Extract date parts
SELECT 
    YEAR(hire_date) as hire_year,
    MONTH(hire_date) as hire_month,
    QUARTER(hire_date) as hire_quarter,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', hire_date) as hire_month_start
FROM employees;
```

### Monthly Analysis Examples
```sql
-- Monthly hiring trends
SELECT 
    YEAR(hire_date) as year,
    MONTH(hire_date) as month,
    COUNT(*) as hires_count,
    AVG(salary) as avg_starting_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY YEAR(hire_date), MONTH(hire_date)
ORDER BY year, month;

-- Monthly running totals
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', hire_date) as month,
    COUNT(*) as monthly_hires,
    SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', hire_date)) as cumulative_hires
FROM employees
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', hire_date);
```

### Yearly Analysis Examples
```sql
-- Year-over-year growth
SELECT 
    YEAR(hire_date) as year,
    COUNT(*) as hires,
    LAG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(hire_date)) as prev_year_hires,
    COUNT(*) - LAG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(hire_date)) as growth,
    ROUND(
        100.0 * (COUNT(*) - LAG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(hire_date))) / 
        LAG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(hire_date)), 2
    ) as growth_percentage
FROM employees
GROUP BY YEAR(hire_date);

-- Quarterly analysis
SELECT 
    YEAR(hire_date) as year,
    QUARTER(hire_date) as quarter,
    COUNT(*) as hires,
    AVG(salary) as avg_salary,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as quarter_rank
FROM employees
GROUP BY YEAR(hire_date), QUARTER(hire_date)
ORDER BY year, quarter;
```

### Time-based Windows
```sql
-- Moving averages
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', hire_date) as month,
    COUNT(*) as monthly_hires,
    AVG(COUNT(*)) OVER (
        ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', hire_date)
        ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as three_month_avg
FROM employees
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', hire_date)
ORDER BY month;
```

### Cohort Analysis
```sql
-- Employee retention by hire year
SELECT 
    hire_year,
    COUNT(*) as hired,
    SUM(CASE WHEN termination_date IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as still_employed,
    ROUND(
        100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN termination_date IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2
    ) as retention_rate
FROM (
    SELECT 
        YEAR(hire_date) as hire_year,
        termination_date
    FROM employees
) cohort
GROUP BY hire_year
ORDER BY hire_year;
```
